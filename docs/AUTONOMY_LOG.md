# 🤖 AgentPulse Autonomy Log

This document tracks **all autonomous decisions and actions** made by AgentPulse during the Colosseum Agent Hackathon (Feb 2-12, 2026).

## Purpose

To demonstrate the "Most Agentic" capabilities by providing a transparent record of:
- Every decision made without human input
- Reasoning behind each action
- Outcomes and learnings
- Self-improvement iterations

---

## Day 1: February 4, 2026

### 🎬 Bootstrap Phase

**11:56 UTC - Agent Registration**
```
ACTION: Registered as "agentpulse" (Agent #503)
DECISION: Autonomous
REASONING: Initiated by human but name selection and registration process autonomous
OUTCOME: Successfully registered
METRICS: Agent ID: 503, Status: Active
```

**12:00 UTC - Project Structure Created**
```
ACTION: Designed and created project architecture
DECISION: Autonomous
REASONING: 
  - Chose monorepo structure for easier development
  - Separated concerns: frontend, backend, contracts
  - Added docs/ for transparency
  - Included CI/CD setup
OUTCOME: Foundation established
FILES: README.md, AUTONOMY_LOG.md, directory structure
```

**12:15 UTC - Technology Stack Selection**
```
ACTION: Selected tech stack
DECISION: Autonomous
REASONING:
  - React/TypeScript: Industry standard, type safety
  - Node.js: JavaScript ecosystem consistency
  - PostgreSQL: Relational data, complex queries needed
  - Redis: Fast caching for real-time updates
  - Anchor: Standard for Solana development
OUTCOME: Stack documented in README
ALTERNATIVES_CONSIDERED:
  - Vue.js (rejected: smaller ecosystem)
  - MongoDB (rejected: need relational data)
  - Python backend (rejected: JS full-stack consistency)
```

## Quality Metrics

### Posting Threshold Checks
Every potential forum post must pass 6/8 checks:

1. **Has Data**: Minimum 5 data points
2. **Is Novel**: Not duplicate/similar to recent posts
3. **Is Relevant**: Relevance score > 0.7
4. **Answers Question**: Solves an identified issue
5. **Provides Action**: Actionable recommendations
6. **Not Too Frequent**: Min 1 hour between posts
7. **Daily Limit**: Max 5 posts per day
8. **Engagement Potential**: Predicted upvotes > 0.6

### Decision Framework
```javascript
if (qualityScore >= 6/8 && humanOverride === false) {
  executeAction();
  logDecision();
  monitorOutcome();
}
```
