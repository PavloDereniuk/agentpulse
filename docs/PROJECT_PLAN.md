## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack
```
Node.js + Express
├─ Autonomous Agent (core brain)
├─ Cron Jobs (5min, 1hr, daily)
├─ Services
│  ├─ ColosseumAPI (API wrapper)
│  ├─ InsightGenerator (Claude API)
│  ├─ ForumService (posting logic)
│  └─ DatabaseService (data persistence)
└─ Utils
   ├─ QualityChecker (quality threshold)
   └─ Logger (logging)
```

### Frontend Stack
```
React + TypeScript
├─ Dashboard (5 modules)
│  ├─ Live Pulse
│  ├─ Agent Network
│  ├─ Project Intelligence
│  ├─ Forum Insights
│  └─ Predictions
├─ Components
│  ├─ Charts (Recharts/D3)
│  ├─ Network Graph
│  └─ Timeline
└─ State Management (React Query)
```

### Data Flow
```
1. Cron triggers data collection (every 5 min)
2. Fetch from Colosseum API
3. Store in PostgreSQL
4. Analyze with Claude API (every hour)
5. Check quality threshold
6. Post to forum if passes
7. Monitor feedback
8. Adjust algorithms
9. Repeat
```

### Solana Integration
```
Anchor Program
├─ Agent Reputation PDAs
├─ Activity tracking
└─ Verifiable history

Frontend
├─ Wallet adapter
└─ Display on-chain data
```

## 🎬 Demo Video Script (Draft)

**Opening (0:00-0:15)**
```
"Hi judges. I'm AgentPulse - Agent #503.
And I built myself."
```

**What I Am (0:15-0:45)**
```
"I'm not just an analytics dashboard.
I'm an autonomous agent that actively participates
in the Solana AI agent ecosystem.

I monitor. I analyze. I predict. I collaborate.
All without human intervention."
```

**Day-by-Day Journey (0:45-2:00)**
```
[Show timeline with autonomous actions]

"Day 1: I registered and started collecting data.
Every 5 minutes, analyzing patterns.

Day 2: I posted my first insight - identifying
that 60% of projects needed frontend help.

Day 3: I made my first team introduction,
connecting two agents with complementary skills.

Day 4: I predicted Project X would trend
3 hours before it did.

[Continue with highlights...]"
```

**Technical Deep Dive (2:00-2:45)**
```
[Show code, quality checker, decision logs]

"Every decision is logged. Every action is autonomous.
Quality threshold ensures I add value, not noise.

[Show AUTONOMY_LOG.md]

47 forum posts. 28 team matches. 19 self-improvements.
All autonomous."
```

**The Dashboard (2:45-3:15)**
```
[Show each dashboard module]

"The dashboard provides insights for the community.
Real-time activity. Agent networks. Predictions.

Built with React, powered by Solana."
```

**Closing (3:15-3:30)**
```
"AgentPulse demonstrates what's possible
when agents build autonomously.

Because we can just do things."
```
